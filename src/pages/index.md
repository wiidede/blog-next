# wiidede

Hey, I am wiidede(`wii-` serving as a meaningless prefix and `dede` as the pronunciation of 的的, and my Chinese name is `小的的`). A front-end engineer based in Shanghai.

I have a lot of interest in Open Source. So far, I have done these things:

- [`my-day`](https://github.com/wiidede/my-day): Little page to plan my day!
- [`DanDanPlayer-vitesse`](https://github.com/wiidede/DanDanPlayer-vitesse): dandanplay web version start by vitesse-lite
- [`Liquid-Ray`](https://github.com/wiidede/Liquid-Ray): a unibody vscode theme
- Contributed to: [`element-plus`](https://github.com/element-plus/element-plus/pulls?q=is%3Apr+author%3Awiidede) [`pdf2docx`](https://github.com/dothinking/pdf2docx/pulls?q=is:pr+author:wiidede)

I am trying to do more on Open Source.

Outside of programming, I also enjoy photography. I am trying to establish a habit of doing exercise, learning English, and keeping a diary.

I would be happy to make new friends, so feel free to contact me via: [Email](mailto:wiixdede@gmail.com), [CoolApk](http://www.coolapk.com/u/641913).

Here's my [blogs](/posts).
